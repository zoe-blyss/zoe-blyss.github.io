    <h2>About Christine Thurston</h2>
    
    <p>All people experience problems and at times we all need someone that we
    can trust to assist us with those challenges. As a therapist, my approach is
    accepting, empathetic, and flexible, and I strive to form a relationship with my clients that is built on trust and respect. I believe in working
    collaboratively with my clients, together identifying the growth and change
    that they desire for their lives. I work to help my clients uncover their
    internal resources and strengths and to expand their understanding of their
    experiences in order to empower them to make the changes that they
    desire.</p>

    <p>Though I am committed to helping people with all manner of difficulties
    and personal challenges, I am particularly adept at helping people suffering
    from depression/anxiety, clients confronting women’s issues, and couples
    therapy. I also have specialized experience in helping people facing the
    unique challenges of acute and chronic illness, especially cancer.</p>

    <p>Although a white American woman, I have diverse and unique life
    experiences, as well as, formal specialized education in multiculturalism
    and diversity issues. I bring a cultural sensitivity and awareness to therapy and I welcome the opportunity to engage with people who have different backgrounds, histories, and cultures than mine.</p>
