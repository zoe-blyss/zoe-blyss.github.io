    <h1>FAQs</h1>

    <h2>How do I begin?</h2>
    <p>Simply call or email us for a free phone consultation. If we are unable to take your call you may leave a message on our confidential voicemail and we will return your call as soon as possible. You may also choose to email us and we will contact your within 24 hours.</p>
    <p class="p--last">Once we have had a phone consultation, we will determine an appointment time.</p>

    <h2>How long does therapy take?</h2>
    <p class="p--last">Because all families and individuals are unique change occurs differently for different people. Generally, people attend therapy for a 1hour (50 minute) session once per week. Some people benefit from brief solution-focused therapy usually lasting six to eight sessions. Other people see the results they are looking for after a longer commitment to therapy. Ultimately, the duration depends upon the type of issues the clients are facing and the client’s energy and commitment to therapy.</p>

    <h2>How does therapy work?</h2>
    <p>Psychotherapy is not like visiting a medical doctor. At it’s most basic, it is an ongoing, deep conversation that requires a very active involvement of both the therapist and client. As a client, you are the director of your therapy and your therapist will work to help you with the challenges that you wish to focus on and the changes that you want to make in your life. Therapy requires your very active involvement. It requires your best efforts to change thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It requires your best effort to be open and honest with yourself.</p>
    <p class="p--last">An important part of your therapy will be practicing new skills that you
    will learn in your sessions. You will be asked to practice outside our meetings. You might be asked to do exercises, keep records, and read to deepen your learning. You will probably have to work on relationships in your life and make long-term efforts to get the best results. These are important parts of personal change. Change will sometimes be easy and quick, and sometimes it will be slow and frustrating, and you will need to keep trying. Though there are no instant, painless cures, you can learn new ways of looking at your problems that will be very helpful for changing your feelings and reactions. Essentially, the more seriously you take your therapy, and the more effort you put into it, the faster and better results you will see.</p>

    <h2>How much does therapy cost?</h2>
    <p>The cost of a 50-minute therapy session is $120.</p>
    <p>*As I am unable to accept insurance at this time I will be offering a reduced cash rate of $80 per session. Once I have been cleared to accept insurance my rates will return to the industry standard of $120 per hour. Clients will be notified well in advance of any change in fees.</p>
    <p class="p--last">We accept cash and credit cards.</p>
